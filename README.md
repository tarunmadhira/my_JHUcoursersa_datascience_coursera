This is the course project for course 3 week 4. The R script, run_analysis.R, does the following:

Download the dataset (if it does not already exist)
Load activity and feature info and both the training and test datasets, and keeps only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation.
Loads the activity and subject data for each dataset and merges those columns with the dataset.
Merges the two datasets.
Converts the activity and subject columns into factors.
Creates a tidy dataset consisiting of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
The end result is shown in the file tidy.txt.
